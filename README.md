# GlyphsApp Scripts

Or rather, script singular. Four to mellow. Fore tomorrow. More to follow.

## MasterBlaster.py

The script takes a comma separated list from input or local txt file and displays each entry in all available masters. If the local file fails to load presets can also be set within the script itself.

Dummy presets are defined in MasterBlaster-presets.txt. You’ll want to edit according to your needs. Each line represents one list and like UI input must be comma separated. 

At the moment it doesn’t handle GlyphsApp glyph names and the Vanilla List of presets remains abridged till I find a fix. Tested in Glyphs 2.4.2 OS X 10.10.5.
