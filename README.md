# GlyphsApp-Scripts

Or rather, script singular. More to follow.

## MasterBlaster.py

The script takes a comma separated list from input or local txt file and displays in all available masters. If the local file doesn’t load presets can also be easily set within the script itself.

Sample presets are defined in MasterBlaster-presets.txt. Each line represents one list and like UI input must be comma separated.

At the moment it doesn’t handle GlyphsApp glyph names.
